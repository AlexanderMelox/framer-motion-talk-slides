## 🤔 What is Framer motion?

An open source React library to power production-ready animations.
Design fluid animations for the web, across desktop and mobile.

<strong>📚 TLDR;</strong>

It's an amazing react animation library that allows you to easily
add animations to your site all through Javascript. It's also really fast using your GPU to achieve 60 FPS animations.

## 🏃🏼‍♀️Let's animate an element!

To start animating, we just have to convert an HTML element, into a `<motion.element />`.

Then you can set an **initial** prop and an **animate** prop to get started!

It's super easy, here are some examples of what you can animate:

<ul>
  <li>opacity</li>
  <li>scale</li>
  <li>skew</li>
  <li>rotate</li>
  <li>x</li>
  <li>y</li>
</ul>

We can also control the duration and delay with a **transition** prop.

<InitialAndAnimate />

## You can also do these on hover and tap! 👆🏼

<HoverAndTap />

## Framer motion uses these things called variants

**Variants** allow you to define animation states and organize them by name.

They allow us to control animations throughout a component tree by switching a single **animate** prop.

This is great for **orchestration**!

<Variants />

## Drag, is no longer a drag.

To make a component draggable, you just add a **drag** prop and what axis

<Drag />
