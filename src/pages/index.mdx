## 🤔 What is Framer motion?

An open source React library to power production-ready animations.

<strong>📚 TLDR;</strong>

It's an amazing react animation library that allows you to easily
add animations to your site all through Javascript. It's also really fast using your GPU to achieve 60 FPS animations.

`}</Highlight>

## 🏃🏼‍♀️Let's animate an element!

To start animating, we just have to convert an HTML element, into a `<motion.element />`.

Then you can set an **initial** prop and an **animate** prop to get started!

It's super easy, here are some examples of what you can animate:

<ul>
  <li>
    <span role="img">✅</span>opacity
  </li>
  <li>
    <span role="img">✅</span>scale
  </li>
  <li>
    <span role="img">✅</span>skew
  </li>
  <li>
    <span role="img">✅</span>rotate
  </li>
  <li>
    <span role="img">✅</span>x
  </li>
  <li>
    <span role="img">✅</span>y
  </li>
</ul>

We can also control the duration and delay with a **transition** prop.

<InitialAndAnimate />

## You can also do these on hover and tap! 👆🏼

<HoverAndTap />

## Framer motion uses these things called variants

**Variants** allow you to define animation states and organize them by name.

They allow us to control animations throughout a component tree by switching a single **animate** prop.

This is great for **orchestration**!

<Variants />

## Drag, is no longer a drag

To make a component draggable, you just add a **drag** prop and what axis you want it to drag on.

If you don't want the element to be yeeted off the page, you can add the **dragContraints** prop.

If you want the **dragContraints** to be the size of the parent's, you can pass it the <br /> parents `dragContraints={parentRef}`.

<Drag />

# Scroll

You can create scroll animations with the `useViewportScroll` hook framer motion provides. You can create effects like parallax or progress bars!

<Scroll />

# Let's put it all together!

Let's make a modal with everything we have learned.
